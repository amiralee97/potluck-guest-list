# **Potluck Guest List**

Potluck Guest List is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of who is bringing what dish to a potluck event. Users can add and remove guests, assign dishes to guests, and view the full guest list with assigned dishes.

This application was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## **Usage**

To use this application, simply open the **`index.html`** file in your preferred web browser. You will be presented with a form where you can add guests and their assigned dishes, as well as a table that displays the full guest list.

Alternatively, you can launch the site with GitHub Pages by visiting the following link: **[https://amiralee97.github.io/potluck-guest-list/](https://amiralee97.github.io/potluck-guest-list/)**
